## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS

### What I learned

I learned how to position elements with CSS Grid. Also, with the use of @media queries I had the freedom to add different breakpoints to my application to make a responsive web page. In addition, I learned to make different color schemes available based on the user's default color (dark or light).
